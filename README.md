# Steam Elevator
A tool for easily restarting Steam in elevated mode (run as administrator) or normal mode.

# Why did I make this?
I play two games made by HoYoverse, **Genshin Impact** and **Honkai: Star Rail**. These games both run in elevated mode, and when using them as non-Steam games in Steam, this elevation can cause problems (especially with Steam Link). I created this tool to make it easier to switch Steam between elevated and normal mode.

# Can I install this?
Yes, you can find it at https://littlebitstudios.com/software/steamelevator.
